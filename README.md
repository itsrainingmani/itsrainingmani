# Hi there 👋🏼

Welcome to my profile where I am doing things with code

I was most recently a part of the Winter 2, 2024 batch at [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) where I explored Rust, little web projects and pairing with my fellow Recursers!

🔭 Currently working on - 
 - [Bresson](https://github.com/itsrainingmani/bresson) - An EXIF metadata editor in your Terminal!
 - [SoundWave](https://github.com/itsrainingmani/soundwave) - Gesture Recognition through Sound in Rust
 - Redesigning my personal [website](https://itsrainingmani.dev)
 - Palette Generators ([valpalette](https://itsrainingmani.github.io/valpalette))

⚡ Fun fact: Open up a Python IDLE and type in `import antigravity`
