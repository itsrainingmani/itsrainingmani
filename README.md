# Hi there 👋🏼

Welcome to my profile where I am doing things with code. Feel free to poke around and sift through.

🔭 Things I am currently working on/learning - 
 - The Rust Adventure course by [@partycorgi](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi) and trying to polish up some of my older projects
 - Chapter [20](http://craftinginterpreters.com/hash-tables.html) of [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com)
 - [Rust Atomics and Locks](https://marabos.nl/atomics/)
 - Trying to figure out my next open-source project to contribute to

⚡ Fun fact: Open up a Python IDLE and type in `import antigravity`
