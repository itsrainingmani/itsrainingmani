# Hi there 👋🏼

Welcome to my profile where I am doing things with code. Feel free to poke around and sift through.

🔭 I'm currently re-learning Rust through the Rust Adventure course by [@partycorgi](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi) and trying to polish up some of my older projects.

⚡ Fun fact: Open up a Python IDLE and type in `import antigravity`

*P.S Future Digital Archaelogists - I'm sorry for not adding more comments*
