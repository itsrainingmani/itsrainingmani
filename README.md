# Hi there 👋🏼

Welcome to my profile where I am doing things with code

I was most recently a part of the Winter 2, 2024 batch at [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) where I explored Rust, little web projects and pairing with my fellow Recursers!

🔭 Currently experimenting with - 
 - [Bresson](https://github.com/itsrainingmani/bresson) - A lightweight photo metadata editor/cleaner in your Terminal!
 - [SyncAlarm](https://github.com/itsrainingmani/SyncAlarm) - iOS App that syncs alarms between your iPhone and Apple Watch
 - [Tailnode](https://github.com/itsrainingmani/tailnode) - Terminal Interface for managing Tailscale+Mullvad VPN Exit Nodes
 - Redesigning my personal [website](https://itsrainingmani.dev)

👯 I’m looking for -
- Software Engineer Roles (Preferably startups working on cool engineering challenges)
- Contract opportunities (Web developement/design, Developer Experience Tooling etc)

⚡ Fun fact: Open up a Python IDLE and type in `import antigravity`
